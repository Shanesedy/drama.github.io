<h2>How Video Games and Theatre Correlate</h2>
  
  <ul>
 One of my main research interests is how the mediums of video games and theatre are similar with each other, and how theatre is utilizing elements from games.
  
  <li>Spectators as Players</li>
 Theatre has always been an interactive medium, reliant on the audience to at least emit a pressence. At the very basic notion, the audience is expected to clap after each number in a musical, and if the peroformance is truly compelling, they will clap more. The actors in return, feed off of this energy shaping the experience. The experience is different each performance and is reliant on the audience to participate just as a video game is reliant on a player to play it. 
 
 <li>Gamified Theatre</li>
 In recent years, theatre has become more experimental and what it has meant to be a spectator has changed. Different productions such as Sleep No More have pushed the boundaries of what theatre is and can do.
