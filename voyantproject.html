  <h1>Jane Austen Voyant Project</h1>
  <p>
   <h3>I am currently taking an entire class devoted to Jane Austen. As I have been reading, I have noticed some tendencies in word usage.
     I noticed the frequent use of the title words, specifically "sense." The interesting thing I found was that it was occuring frequently 
     in her other works, not just exclusively to <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>. This is why I decided to explore the works of Jane Austen using Voyant.
     After exploring the corpus for a while, I began to notice some interesting word trends and patterns. A specific thing I am noticing is that
     although Austen is known for these great romance novels, love has little to do with it. Marrigage equals happiness, not love. And 
     knowledge is valued higher than one might think.</h3>
     
  <h2> Full Corpus Word Cloud</h2>

  <h3>Looking at the word cloud, the words that stuck out to me were "know," "thought," and "think." After having read some of the essential
  Austen novels, these words did not surprise me. Austen's leading ladies are typically smart. But, then I noticed the word "little." 
  I was linking "know" and "little" in my mind, so I looked at them in links and sure enough, "little" links to "think" and "know." </h3>
 
  <h2>Full Corpus Links</h2>

  <h3>Continuing to explore the links, there were a couple more interesting things I found. First, was that the word "good" appears in blue,
  and it links to "sense," "deal," "humor," and "man." I am interested in the last two. Although women are central to the plots of Austen's
  novels, "good men" are a main focus. This can partially be viewed as Austen's commentary on society, but I still found it interesting.
  Second, when I entered "marriage," it linked to one word: "happiness." Again, this can be seen as comentary on society, but in that respect,
  It still poses a valid point about what society values. There is a reason these novels are still relevant today, this link is probably a major 
    part of that. If you do not believe me, turn on the Hallmark Channel or watch almost any of the Disney princess movies, you will see my point.</h3>
  
  <h2>Full Corpus Marriage Trends</h2>
  <iframe style='width: 477px; height: 438px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?stopList=keywords-257ff9244937b0b376d5b6857cdcf0cb&query=husband*&query=wife*&query=proposal*&query=wedding*&query=wedd*&query=wedded&query=marriage*&bins=8&corpus=austen'></iframe>
  
  <h3>Knowing the importance of marriage, I wanted to look at marriage specific terms, and see in which works they trended. Out of the words
  I entered, "wife," "husband," and "marriage" charted the highest, all hovering around each other. They spiked specifically in <i> Lady Susan,
    Pride and Prejudice</i>, and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>. These novels being high did not surprise me, though I thought others might be higher.
    "Wife" spiked rather high with <i>Emma</i>, but the other two did not chart as high. This surprised me because Emma is a matchmaking character and I thought
  their occurence would be among the highest in her respective novel. Nonetheless, the words are charting pretty high across all of the works, so
  there is no mistaking their importance.</h3>
  
  <h2>Full Corpus Title Trends</h2>
  <iframe style='width: 477px; height: 438px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?stopList=keywords-257ff9244937b0b376d5b6857cdcf0cb&query=friendship*&query=persuasion*&query=sensibility*&query=sense*&query=prejudice*&query=pride*&bins=8&corpus=austen'></iframe>
 
  <h3>While working with the trends, I decided to explore the thought that began my interest. I entered the title words that were not names or places.
  Not surprisingly to me, "sense" charted high, it was the highest across the board with the exception of "pride" in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>
    (no surprise there either) and "sensibility" in <i>Love and Friendship</i>. I have yet to read <i>Love and Friendship</i>, so I cannot speak to
  it too much, but it did surprise me that "sensibility" occurred the most there rather than its namesake novel. Overall, the most interesting word
  was still "sense" to me. It consistently appears throughout all of her works. It also is used most prior to <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>
    It trends highest in <i>Lady Susan</i> which is much shorter. However, Lady Susan as a character, probably has the most sense. The question
    this poses though, is when did "sense" become so interesting to Austen. <i>Pride, Sense</i>, and <i>Lady Susan</i> Were all kind of being worked
    on at the same time. So did "sense" appear so frequently in <i>Lady Susan</i> because of the other novels, or was it the other way around?</h3>
  
  <h2>Full Corpus Theatre</h2>
  <iframe style='width: 477px; height: 438px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?stopList=keywords-257ff9244937b0b376d5b6857cdcf0cb&query=shakespeare*&query=stage*&query=performance*&query=performer*&query=actor*&query=theatricals&bins=8&corpus=austen'></iframe>
  
  <h3>One final thing I used links to examine was "theatre." I am currently reading <i>Mansfield Park</i>, and there is a major segment involving
    performance. The words spike during <i>Mansfield</i>, but "stage" and "performance" are highest in <i>Love and Friendship</i> and <i> Northanger Abbey</i>.
  I chose not to explore this more here, but this data will be useful to me in crafting my final project for my Austen class and I thought it displayed how useful Voyant can be in crafting research questions.</h3>
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <h3>In closing, Voyant helped me to think about how important specific words and concepts are to Austen while reading her works. 
  Her novels consistently utilize the marriage plot, but the connection between "marriage" and "happiness" caused me to think about it differently.
  The frequent use of the word "sense" showed its overall importance to Austen in all of her works. Seeing the links surrounding "knowledge" aand "marriage"
    accentuates their importance to Austen's works and the commentary they provide on society. Seeing these interesting connections has 
  reshaped what I as see as I am continuing to read Austen, and will help me to build a deeper understanding of her body of work.</h3>
