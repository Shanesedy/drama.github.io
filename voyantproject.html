  <h1>Jane Austen Voyant Project</h1>
  <p>
   <h3>I am currently taking an entire class devoted to Jane Austen. As I have been reading, I have noticed some tendencies in word usage.
     I noticed the frequent use of the title words, specifically "sense." The interesting thing I found was that it was occuring frequently 
     in her other works, not just exclusively to <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>. This is why I decided to explore the works of Jane Austen using Voyant.
     After exploring the corpus for a while, I began to notice some interesting word trends and patterns. A specific thing I am noticing is that
     although Austen is known for these great romance novels, love has little to do with it. Marrigage equals happiness, not love. And 
     knowledge is valued higher than one might think.</h3>

  <h3>Looking at the word cloud, the words that stuck out to me were "know," "thought," and "think." After having read some of the essential
  Austen novels, these words did not surprise me. Austen's leading ladies are typically smart. But, then I noticed the word "little." 
  I was linking "know" and "little" in my mind, so I looked at them in links and sure enough, "little" links to "think" and "know." </h3>

  <h3>Continuing to explore the links, there were a couple more interesting things I found. First, was that the word "good" appears in blue,
  and it links to "sense," "deal," "humor," and "man." I am interested in the last two. Although women are central to the plots of Austen's
  novels, "good men" are a main focus. This can partially be viewed as Austen's commentary on society, but I still found it interesting.
  Second, when I entered "marriage," it linked to one word: "happiness." Again, this can be seen as comentary on society, but in that respect,
  It still poses a valid point about what society values. There is a reason these novels are still relevant today, this link is a major part of that.</h3>
