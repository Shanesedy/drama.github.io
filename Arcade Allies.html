Arcade Allies is a collaborative hypertext created for the Digital Literature Festival at IUP on April 25, 2018.

You get a text message sent to your phone, when you check it, beams of light shoot from your phone and you get sucked in through the screen.

For a moment, everything is black. Then there is a sudden burst of neon lights.

&quot;Welcome to the Arcade of Awesome!&quot; reads a wall of text that is beamed in front of you. You continue reading, &quot;A mysterious dark force has stripped the magical arcade cabinets of their games. You have been chosen to join the Arcade Allies. Your task if you so choose to join is to join your fellow allies and help replenish the games of old or create the games of the future!&quot;

As soon as you finish reading, several mysterious [[cabinets|Enter]] appear in front of you.








(display: &quot;menu-no-home&quot;)                   </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Enter" tags="Grid" position="628,297">You see six cabinets in front of you:

[[Super Safari|Safari]] 
[[Medieval Mayhem|Medieval]] 
[[Space Scoundrels|Space]]  
[[Lazerz!]]
[[Crazy Cats]]
[[Golf!]]

As you stare at the decked out cabinets with black screens in front of you, a controller appears in your hand. On it, there is a button that says [[New Cabinet]].

The Haunted Hypertext is a collaborative hypertext created as part of the National Day on Writing Carnival at IUP on October 20, 2017.

[[Read more]] about the writing accomplished during the carnival.

## Hypertext
Tradtional print literature, from poems to stories, works with the linear constraints of the book.  *Hypertext* names the branching, multi-linear web of possibilites that can be imagined when we shift to a spatial metaphor. Pages become passages, and each passage can lead to another. One passage can open to many, a path can lead you on an adventure, into a labyrinth, or toward an impossible dead end.

## Contribute
Some hypertexts are written by a single author for readers to explore and enjoy.  This story is incomplete. Once you have travelled through the haunted paths laid out before you, we invite you to author a new passage. 

You can choose where it should be linked and what it should lead towards ... an new possiblity, back to a familiar place, a dead end?  Others will follow and leave their traces.

When you are ready, please [[Write]] the next move for us.  

## Mechanics
Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, boomed the voice of the wizard. 

Actually, we are happy to share the method behind this madness.  The Haunted Hypertext was conceived by members of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iupdhc.org&quot;&gt;IUP Center for Digital Humanities and Culture&lt;/a&gt;.  The writing tool we are using is an &quot;an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories&quot; called &lt;a href=&quot;http://twinery.org/&quot;&gt; Twine&lt;/a&gt;. 

Unfortunately, Twine itself is designed for single authors. So if you visit the [[Write]] page, you will be directed to a submission form. Here you can author a passage and submit it. Our [[Wizards]] will then add your contributions and others, upload a new version and publish it on the web at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iuphdc.org/haunted/index.html&quot;&gt;www.iuphdc.org/haunted/index.html&lt;/a&gt;.  

Feel free to visit and enjoy this in the weeks and months to come. Amaze your friends and family.  We intend to host the end &quot;product&quot; indefinitely.
